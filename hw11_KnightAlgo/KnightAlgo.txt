Use a Recursive Brute Force Approach

Use a For loop and go through every single space on the Chess board
for starting points.
Put in a counter for moves, Knight's move order will be marked
down with this
Then add the Knight and do a recursive call for every single move the
Knight can make.
Make sure to remove the Knight after each recursive call to make room
for the next one.
If the number of moves are made is equal to the total number of spaces
then print the solution and return true.
If no more moves can be made and less than the number of spaces of moves
have been made, return false.
