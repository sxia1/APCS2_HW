Q0: What do you make of the multiple class definitions in a single .java file?
Notes: Boardasaurus is not public or private. If it were, the file would not compile. My hypothesis that this file would not run if there were 2 classes was only partially correct. Due to the lack of public in the declaration of class Boardasaurus I believe that Boardasaurus can only be accessed within Demo.java.
